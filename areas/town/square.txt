name: Town Square
description: The town square shows signs that it was once a busy place. Stalls where merchants would sell good are now abandoned. Footprints and wheel tracks seem old and faded, save for a few new paths. To the north lies a large church, its steeple climbing towards the gray sky. To the east, a building with recognizable equipment scattered around, and a sign that reads "Smithy". To the west, a small shop can be seen, with a sign reading "Parson's General Goods".
