name: Pellan Inn
description: As you enter the door, the innkeeper eyes you down. He gives you a very clear glare. The inn is small and dirty, but feels homely. There is a fire in the fireplace, with a few comfortable looking chairs around the room, most facing the fireplace. To the east is the door back outside.
